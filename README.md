This is an implementation of Ladder Network in TensorFlow. Ladder network is a deep learning algorithm that combines supervised and unsupervised learning. It was introduced in the paper _Semi-Supervised Learning with Ladder Network_ by A Rasmus, H Valpola, M Honkala, M Berglund, and T Raiko.

## Revision
- Running with python 3.x and tensorflow 1.3.0
- Ladder network on semi-supervised learning
- Training Lending Club dataset (https://www.lendingclub.com/info/download-data.action)
- Use GPU on parallel
